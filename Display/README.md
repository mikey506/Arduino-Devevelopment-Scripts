Make sure to install the required libraries before uploading this script to your Arduino Uno. The **Adafruit_GFX** and **Adafruit_SSD1306** libraries can be installed from the Arduino Library Manager.

This script initializes the OLED display, displays a welcome message for 2 seconds, and then starts a loop that counts from 0 to 9, updating the display every second.
