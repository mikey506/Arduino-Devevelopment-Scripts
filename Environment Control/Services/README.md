Make sure to replace SSID and PASSWORD with your actual WiFi network credentials. Additionally, you may need to install the required libraries (credentials.lua, lfs.lua, and httpserver.lua) on your ESP8266 board to run this script successfully.

Please note that this is a simplified script for demonstration purposes, and you may need to modify and adapt it further to meet your specific requirements.
